You need the following programs if you want to compile the ML parser.

bison 1.875a
flex 2.5.31
gcc 2.95.4

running `make' on the 'converter' directory should Just Work.
(The current binary is compiled for Darwin Kernel Version 8.6.0, under
MacOS X 10.4.6)

To run the ML examples, cat them through the parser and feed the
resulting code to the MMT.  You must first input the ML specification
by loading the ml.maude file. The following examples assume you are
positioned in the 'ML' directory.

Example:

The `examples/imperative-example.ml' contains the following code:

cml 
 let val x = ref 1 in x := ((!x) + (!x)) end

To execute this code, do the following:

$ cat examples/imperative-example.ml | converter/ml > \
   examples/imperative-example.msdf

To run it, assuming you have defined the 'mmt' alias properly, do the
following:

$ mmt ../cmsos.msdf semantics/ml.maude examples/imperative-example.maude
