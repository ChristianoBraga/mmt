Constructive MSOS
=================

Mosses's (http://www.cs.swan.ac.uk/~cspdm/) Constructive MSOS (CMSOS)
is a technique for the specification of programming languages
semantics based on the idea that each language construction should be
specified in a separated module and the complete language
specification is based on the combination of all these modules. A
further generalization that {Constructive} MSOS makes is to use
neutral constructions with regard to a particular programming
language. This allows a high degree of reuse of those modules on a
wide range of programming languages. Mosses's lecture notes contain a
proposed set of these abstract constructions, which we have
implemented and call it also as CMSOS. We also exemplify the use of
these abstract constructions to give the formal semantics of two
different programming languages: a subset ML and a subset of Java,
called MiniJava.
